I heard. I'll come back down as soon as I find out what they want. Thank you, Judy. The body should be disposed of at once, preferably by cremation. Well, how long after death then does the body become reactivated? It's only a matter of minutes. Minutes? Well, that doesn't give people time to make any arrangements. No, you're right. It doesn't give them time to make funeral arrangements. The bodies must be carried to the street and and and burned. They must be burned immediately. Soak them with gasoline and burn them. The bereaved will have to forego the dubious comforts that a funeral service will give. They're just dead flesh and dangerous. I see. Judy, I need you to find some bedspreads or sheets to tear up into small strips. Okay? Is there a fruit cellar here? Yes. We need some bottles or jars to make bottletop cocktails to hold them up while we try to escape. Hey, there's a big can of kerosene down there. I'll see what I can find. I'll look for the bottles. There's a big keyring down there. There may be a key to the gas pump on it. I'll check. We can toss the cocktails from a window upstairs. Meantime, a couple of us can go out and try to get the gas and come back for the rest of the people. But that'll leave a door open someplace. Yeah, that's right. Better be this door. It's closer to the truck. Before we rummage for some supplies behind the cellar door, while we're gone, the rest of you can hold up in there. I found some fruit jars in the cellar, and there's a key on here that's labeled for the gas pump out back.
