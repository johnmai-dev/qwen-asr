Hey, that's us. We're doing all right. Cautious of any suspicious strangers, and keep tuned to your radio and television for survival instructions and further details of this continuing story. Look, I don't know if you're hearing me, but I'm going upstairs now. If anything should try to break in here, I can hear it from up there, and I'll be down to take care of it.
