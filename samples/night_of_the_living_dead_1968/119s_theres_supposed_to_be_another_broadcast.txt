There's supposed to be another broadcast at three o'clock. Ten minutes. Oh, only ten more minutes. We don't have very long to wait. We can leave, or we'd better leave soon. It's ten minutes to three. You know anything about this area at all? I mean, is Willard the nearest town? I don't know. We were just trying to get to a motel before dark. You say those things turned your car over. You think we can get it back on its wheels and drive it? Where is it? Seems like it was pretty far away. Seems like we ran. Forget it. It's at least a mile. Johnny has the keys. You're going to carry that child a mile through that army of things out there? I can carry the kid. What's wrong with her? How'd she get hurt? One of those things grabbed her. Bit her on the arm. What's wrong? Who knows what kind of disease those things carry? Is she conscious? Barely. She can't walk. She's too weak. Well, one of us could try to get to the car. You're going to turn it over by yourself? You have a car? Where? Where is it? You won't be able to start it. Yeah, yeah, I know. But where is it? Good Lord.
